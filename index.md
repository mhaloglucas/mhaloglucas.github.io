## About Me

Hi, I am **Murat Haloglu Castillo** 👋—welcome to my portfolio!

I am passionate about using data to generate business opportunities and answer business challenges (and other fun data projects). With a Master's in Data Science (focus: social analytics) from Durham University and hands-on experience in venture capital, I thrive on tough analytical challenges and creative solutions.

**🔎 Programming Languages & Libraries**
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, matplotlib/seaborn)
- R (tidyverse, caret)
- SQL (BigQuery)

**💼 Experience**
- Former Venture Capital Analyst & Investor @ Plug and Play
- Specialized in Fintech, Energy, and Supply Chain (EMEA & US)

**🚀 Current Focus**
- Deepening expertise in SQL and PyTorch-based deep learning

I am always open to collaborating on data projects or exploring new opportunities. Let's chat!


## Projects

- **[Kaggle dataset: Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/code/murathaloglu/spaceship-titanic-script)**
  - *Description:* Built a binary classification model to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension after the interstellar spacecraft incident.
  - *My contributions and methods:* I performed exploratory data analysis, applied robust imputation for missing data, engineered/encoded features, and experimented with classifiers including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forests, and XGBoost.
  - *Results:* Achieved classification accuracy near 80% (validated on hidden test set).
  - *Interesting fact:* Nearly 80% of passengers in CryoSleep were transported, compared to a significantly lower proportion among those awake. This suggests a possible association between being motionless at the moment of collision and increased likelihood of transportation—an observation that could inspire future analysis.
