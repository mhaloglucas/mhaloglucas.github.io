## Projects
- **[Kaggle dataset: Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/code/murathaloglu/spaceship-titanic-script)**
  - *Description:* Built a binary classification model to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension after the interstellar spacecraft incident.
  - *My contributions and methods:* I performed exploratory data analysis, applied robust imputation for missing data, engineered/encoded features, and experimented with classifiers including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forests, and XGBoost.
  - *Results:* Achieved classification accuracy near 80% (validated on hidden test set).
  - *Interesting fact:* Nearly 80% of passengers in CryoSleep were transported, compared to a significantly lower proportion among those awake. This suggests a possible association between being motionless at the moment of collision and increased likelihood of transportation—an observation that could inspire future analysis.
